# Dynamic Shopping List App

This is a user-friendly, interactive shopping list application developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their shopping lists by adding new items, marking them as bought, and clearing all items with just a few clicks. The app makes use of dynamic DOM updates and showcases practical JavaScript techniques for handling user interactions.

## Core Features

- **Add New Items**: Users can enter items into an input field and click "Add" to add them to the list.
- **Toggle Purchase Status**: Clicking on an item marks it as purchased, visually represented by a strikethrough effect and a color change.
- **Clear the List**: The "Clear List" button allows users to reset the list by removing all items at once.

## Technologies Implemented

- **HTML**: Creates the page structure and the layout of the shopping list.
- **CSS**: Enhances the page's visual design, including styling for buttons and list items.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the functionality of adding, marking as purchased, and clearing the list. Handles user actions through event listeners.

## How to Interact with the App

1. **Adding Items**: 
   - Type the name of an item in the provided input field and click the "Add" button to add the item to your shopping list.
   
2. **Marking an Item as Purchased**:
   - Simply click on any item to mark it as purchased. A visual cue, such as a strikethrough and color change, indicates its new status.

3. **Clearing the List**:
   - To remove all items at once, click the "Clear List" button, and the list will be reset.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the app on your local system, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

   No web server setup is needed because this app runs entirely on the client side.

## File Breakdown

- **index.html**: The HTML file defines the layout of the webpage, which includes an input field for new items, the list container to display them, and the buttons for interaction.
- **styles.css**: Contains the style rules that ensure the page is visually appealing. It handles the look of the shopping list, buttons, and input fields, as well as the dynamic appearance of purchased items.
- **app.js**: Manages the interactive elements of the app, including adding items, marking them as purchased, and clearing the list.

## Example Interaction

1. **Add an Item**:
   - In the input field, type "Eggs" and click "Add". The "Eggs" item will now appear in the list.
   
2. **Mark as Purchased**:
   - Click on the "Eggs" item. It will be marked as purchased, showing a strikethrough and changing the background color.

3. **Clear All Items**:
   - If you've added several items to the list, you can click "Clear List" to remove everything at once.

## Live Demo
